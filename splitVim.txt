A vim session can be split by entering the command
:sp on the command line.
Alternatively, the screen can be given a vertical split with the
:vsp command.

To open a new file in the same vim session,
   the :tabnew command can be used.

   For example,
vim file1.c
:newtab file2.c

gt swaps between the open tabs (//greater tab)

using a after certain commands will execute for all tabs
:wa saves all open tabs
:qa closes all open tabs

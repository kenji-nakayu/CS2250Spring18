Remember, to auto-indent in a VIM c file, sit on a
{ curly brace } and then input =%
This will auto-indent your file.

Alternatively, to auto-indent an entire manual block (not just curly blocks)
sit at the starting point (or hit gg on command line to go back to the
        start of the file)
then enter ma to leave a mark "a"
then got to the end of manual block (or SHIFT+G to go to end of file)
    and then enter =`a
    (` is the lowercase ~, next to 1);

To rearrange the entire file, sit on command line and then
gg
ma
G
=`a

Alternatively, you can sit at the start of the file and then enter
=G to auto indent everything in the file.

gg
=G

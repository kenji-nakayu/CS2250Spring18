To search through the terminal, the grep function is useful.

grep "String to search for" directory/file

for example, to search for use of the random function "rand",

grep "rand" module*/*.c

The * acts as a wildcard, so the above command would search for
"rand" in any directory starting with "module" and
any file that ends with ".c"

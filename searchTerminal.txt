To search through the terminal, the grep function is useful.

grep "String to search for" directory/file

for example, to search for use of the random function "rand",

grep "rand" module*/*.c

The * acts as a wildcard, so the above command would search for
"rand" in any directory starting with "module" and
any file that ends with ".c"


In the command line, you can sit on a word
and use * to highlight all occurrences of that word
Using n on the command line will move to the next occurrence.
Useful for searching to make sure variables are consistent.
Use CTRL + n to deselect the search.

Also, using . in command line inserts a newline at the cursor point
